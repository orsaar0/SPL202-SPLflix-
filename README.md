Streaming service system
SPLFLIX offers users two types of streaming content â€“ movies and tv-episodes,
which belong to a given tv-series. Like most
streaming services we allow a creation of
multiple users, while each user receives userspecific recommendations, according to his
watch history.
Each user stores its own watch history, and can use a different recommendation
algorithm.
